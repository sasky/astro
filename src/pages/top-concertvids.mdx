When I'm feeling particularly disillusioned with humanity, Or just need a to briefly glimpse into the collective one-ness of out species,
I turn to my collection of Youtube vids I have saved over the years to re spark the feels

While my official religion is the one true faith of skeptical agnosticism, bordering on atheism. 
In my more romantic and quasi spiritual musings. I do like to contemplate the connections of our collective souls slowly melding together though
the power of art, music and love.
Through such melding, we come to realise that killing each other and destroying the planet is not the way.
We collectively decide to love our fellow neighbor and stop the fussing and the fighting.
We decide to distribute our abundant resources fairly so nobody wants for anything.
We become true gardens of our precious Earth for our blessed children to inherit.

Some people say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.

In the mean time, while we wait for the dawning of the age of aquarius,
lets do the next best thing, glimpse into the collective love energy (or what have you) by watching recordings where said energy shines through
via the power or music and shared experiences.

## Lorde: Royals -  KCRRW performance 2013

First up, We have Lorde, New Zealand's very own sinestesia space cadet. 
In this clip we have the pleasure of watching Lorde truly immersed in her banger of a pop song.
It's like she has completely shut off the outside world, and all the anxious thoughts that go with it.
She is one with this song. And it's quite the gift to watch.

## Depeche Mode: Enjoy The Silence - Berlin 2014

There is something magical about watching these veteran euro rockers doing what they were put on this planet to do.
We witness the band and the punters consciousness merge into collective love through the power of 80's sync rock.

## Die Antwoord: Enter the Ninja - Pukkelpop 2014

Also pay attention to Ninja when he is not rapping, he does this awesome/ridiculous ninja Kata what have you.

## Meat Loaf: I'd Do Anything For Love  - 2013

The meat, the man. What can I say about this batshit song? This sweaty sweaty man doing what he was born to do, and completely owning it. 
It's nuts.
A pleasure to watch the master of the rock power ballet, teasing the crowd as they beg for more. 
As is the duality of Meat, one watches which equal parts disgust and primal attraction. 
Hits a bit harder since these were his final years.

[This episode of this podcast](https://headgum.com/punch-up-the-jam/id-do-anything-for-love-but-i-wont-do-that-by-meat-loaf-w-chris-fleming)
got me on to this video, It is hilarious. I have listened multiple times while shitting myself with laughter.

## Green Day: Full set - Woodstock 1994
This is a legendary performance in what was a disaster of a festival. If you don't know what happens. It's best just jumping straight in and 
watching this slowly unfolding train wreck.
While not quite the peace and love vibes from the Depeche Mode clip, more a suburban youth anarchy tip. 
One love from a more energetic angle perhaps.
