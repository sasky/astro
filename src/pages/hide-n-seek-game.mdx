**use the arrow and X keys to play**

## How to Play

To play, select the seeker with the arrow keys and press X. 
The idea is to explore our pixelated living room and find the hidden players. 
You start with 10 'looks'. Move around the living room, pressing the look 
button (X) where you think the players might be hiding. If you find a player, 
you get two more looks. If you find everyone with looks remaining, congratulations! 
Press X to play again.

Hours of fun for the whole family, guaranteed or your money back.

## Motivations
My daughters, Arla and Phoebe, love playing hide and seek in our shoebox of a house. 
It's not my favorite game, considering there are only so many hiding places in our
house I can squeeze my fat arse into. Nevertheless, the girls love it, so they 
may nag me into a game or two on a Sunday morning.

## Little mummy and little daddy?

Before the girls came along, Celestina used to create occasional comics, 
usually to mock one of my hobbies of the week. This tradition has stuck, 
and we make each other cards for birthdays and the like. 

Here a few examples

For a while, Arla's imaginary friends were little mummy and little daddy, which might seem a 
tad red-flaggy without context.

## Pico 8 you say?

Yeah, it's a great place to start. The constraints make it ideal. I'd recommend getting
good at it, learning some 2D game physics, and making a few experiments before diving
into something more full-featured like Godot or Bevy. At least, that's my plan
[here's a great place to start](https://www.reddit.com/r/pico8/comments/zz79bw/pico8_101_intro_resources_list/)

Isn't this game a bit subpar?

Look, yes, it is. But it's all part of the plan. This year, I intend to undertake many 
small projects of variable quality in my limited free time (when I haven't succumbed 
to the allure of watching YouTube vids and/or doom scrolling). The plan is to learn 
more math through making small games and also to tackle Rust as a side quest. Wish me luck.
