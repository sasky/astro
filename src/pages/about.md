## Hello, I'm Cameron.


I'm a man of leisure, dad and web developer in Wellington, New Zealand.

I believe we should built things websites and software to last.
I believe coding is best done as part of a team. 
I believe we don't need to rebuild websites every few years. But for that to happen
We need to embrace test driven development, pair programming, fast feedback loops, realistic time frames, culture of refactoring and a obsession with simplicity.


I'm an employee at [Catch Design](https://www.catchdesign.co.nz/) where I'm a senior full stack developer.
