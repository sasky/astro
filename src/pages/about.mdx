## Hello, I'm Cameron. International man of leisure, 

Hobbies, past and present include but not limited to...

Mountain biking, sour dough, Ukulele, panic attacks, eating too many chips, swimming, making playlists on Spotify, running, lifting, bike riding, dJing, Youtube watching, extensively planning what to do when winning the lotto, kombucha, liking the idea of forging but being too scared to eat anything, Reading and watching many computer/software/web dev material. Learning how to dad, configuring vim, ergonomic split mechanical keyboards, learning to spell the same words over and over again, eating extra hot curries, drinking whiskey, drinking wine, drinking beer. drawing cartoons, frisbee golf, buying second hand shirts off the internet, dwelling in existential despair, mediation, doing nothing and going on a potato diet.

### I also do web development for a living, those who want more information about that side of things.

I believe coding is best done as part of a team. 
I believe we don't need to rebuild web apps every few years. 
I believe we need to embrace test driven development, pair programming, fast feedback loops, realistic time frames, culture of refactoring and a obsession with simplicity.

These are my beliefs I have came to after years of doing this shit. Basically I drunk the [uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) Kool-Aid.


I'm an employee at [Catch Design](https://www.catchdesign.co.nz/) where I'm a senior full stack developer.

I've been at Catch for about 5 years, previously other agencies and the occasional start up.
